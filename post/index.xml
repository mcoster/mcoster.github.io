      <title>Reflections on &#39;Make It Stick&#39;</title>

&lt;p&gt;This book was recommended to me by &lt;a href=&#34;http://paulhibbitts.net/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Paul Hibbitts&lt;/a&gt;, who I recently started corresponding with after using his excellent Course Hub skeleton for Grav in an effort to enhance my teaching of a course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe type=&#34;text/html&#34; width=&#34;336&#34; height=&#34;550&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; align=&#34;center&#34; allowfullscreen style=&#34;max-width:100%&#34; src=&#34;https://read.amazon.com.au/kp/card?asin=B00JQ3FN7M&amp;preview=inline&amp;linkCode=kpe&amp;ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_B5XsAbXZD4JCS&#34; &gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A central tenet of the book is that the best, most reliable and efficient techniques for deep learning are not being universally applied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People generally are going about learning in the wrong ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors assert that learning is an acquired skill and the most effective strategies are often counterintuitive. They put forward, with a wealth of well-referenced evidence, the following claims:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learning is deeper and more durable when it is &lt;em&gt;effortful&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learners are &lt;em&gt;poor judges&lt;/em&gt; of when they are learning well vs. when they are not.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Re-reading text&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;massed practice&lt;/em&gt; are popular study techniques, but are among the &lt;em&gt;least productive&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Retrieval practice&lt;/em&gt; is highly effective - much better than re-reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a test, students spend more time restudying the material they missed, and they learn more from it than do their peers who restudy the material without having been tested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spaced practice&lt;/em&gt;, eg. letting yourself get a little rusty between sessions or interspersing study of two or more subjects, is harder and feels less productive, but gives longer lasting and more versatile learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trying to solve a problem &lt;em&gt;before being taught the solution&lt;/em&gt; results in better learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Receiving instruction in the form of your preferred &lt;em&gt;learning style&lt;/em&gt; does not result in better learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interleaved and varied practice&lt;/em&gt; leads to greater ability to extract &lt;em&gt;underlying principles&lt;/em&gt; which leads to a greater success in choosing the right solutions in unfamiliar situations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learners are &lt;em&gt;susceptible to illusions&lt;/em&gt; about what they know and what they can do. Testing helps to calibrate judgments about what has actually been learned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;New learning requires a &lt;em&gt;foundation of prior knowledge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Elaboration&lt;/em&gt; - giving new material meaning by expressing it in one&amp;rsquo;s own words and linking with the learner&amp;rsquo;s existing knowledge - avoids limits to how much can be learned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Putting new knowledge into a &lt;em&gt;larger context&lt;/em&gt; helps learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Complex mastery can be achieved by learning to &lt;em&gt;extract the key ideas from new material and organise them into mental models&lt;/em&gt; and connect those models to prior knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than intellectual ability being hardwired, the brain is highly plastic and adaptive - &lt;em&gt;new learnings change the brain&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;retrieval-practice&#34;&gt;Retrieval practice&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found the sections on the benefits of retrieval practice particularly interesting. As a teacher, a take home message for me is that regular, low-stake testing leads to better learning. Indeed, regular post-lecture or eg. weekly quizzes may be the most powerful means to achieving deep and lasting learning from lecture content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are there any further, indirect benefits of regular, low-stakes classroom testing? Besides strengthening learning and retention, a regime of this kind of testing improves student attendance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And an interesting side-note about online vs in person:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These benefits of low-stakes testing accrue whether instruction is delivered online or in the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got a lot out of reading this book and I&amp;rsquo;m enthusiastic to put a number of new ideas into practice in my teaching in 2018! I highly recommend to anyone involved in teaching and/or learning (isn&amp;rsquo;t that everyone?!). Finally, a big thank again to &lt;a href=&#34;http://paulhibbitts.net/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Paul Hibbitts&lt;/a&gt; for the recommendation! :)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>5 Tips for Great Student Presentations</title>
      <link>https://mcoster.net/post/presentation-tips/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;I recently spent a couple of weeks assessing final year undergraduate presentations on drug discovery topics. Overall, the standard was excellent, and most of the students seemed to get a lot from the experience. I certainly enjoyed it! However, there&amp;rsquo;s always room for improvement - indeed, I always finish my own presentations with ideas of how I could make it better next time. Here&amp;rsquo;s 5 tips for a great presentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-what-are-your-3-key-points&#34;&gt;1. What are your 3 key points?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An audience can only take so much away from any talk, no matter how well crafted. Focus on up to 3 key points. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;No more!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Prepare your whole talk with these three points in mind. Focus on these points in your intro and summary. Make them explicit. When you&amp;rsquo;ve finished your slides, go back through them - how do they relate to the take-home messages you are trying to get across?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-does-your-talk-reflect-the-title&#34;&gt;2. Does your talk reflect the title?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you&amp;rsquo;ve finished your slides, go back to your title - does your talk reflect your title? Eg. If it is &amp;lsquo;Application of technique X to problems Y&amp;rsquo;, do you talk about the technique AND applications? Do your intro and summary slides fully reflect the whole topic?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;3-practice-practice-practice-practice-at-the-venue&#34;&gt;3. Practice, practice, practice! Practice at the venue&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some have the &amp;lsquo;gift of the gab&amp;rsquo;, but most will give a better presentation, the more you practice. If possible, &lt;em&gt;test out your presentation in the venue beforehand&lt;/em&gt;. Are all the slides legible from the back row? This is also the perfect place to practice your talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;4-no-script&#34;&gt;4. No script!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reach the point where you can talk about the slides without reciting from a script. Whether written on the slides, a sheet of paper or memorised, a script normally results in a less engaging talk. Audience engagement is so important and hard to achieve with a scripted speech. Speaker notes are ok, incase you get stuck, but not whole sentences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;5-turn-up-to-the-venue-early&#34;&gt;5. Turn up to the venue early&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Preload your talk, find where the &amp;lsquo;Start presentation&amp;rsquo; button is and go through at least a few slides to make sure everything is working ok. If using a pointing device - practice. Try out the microphone, try out the lights, get used to the stage. Get a friend to sit in the back row and give feedback. On that matter - practice in front of friends, peers, mentors as much as you can and listen to their feedback!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; that all of my tips relate to preparation - to my mind, that is the biggest differentiator! Good luck, and knock their socks off!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Magic Science Show!</title>
      <link>https://mcoster.net/post/magic-science-show-2017/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 18 Aug 2017 15:52:02 +1000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://mcoster.net/post/magic-science-show-2017/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, 12 August, Cohan (a chemistry student) and I performed a &amp;ldquo;Magic Science Show&amp;rdquo; as part of the launch of National Science Week 2017. I&amp;rsquo;ve put together some highlights below:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; padding-top: 30px; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/fevkPq_1ops&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;&#34; allowfullscreen frameborder=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were really pleased to get a good crowd, with lots of enthusiastic young kids (and their parents) in the audience. I told them that this was our first time performing the show (true!) and that they should watch really closely for anything that went wrong.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;https://mcoster.net/img/magic-science-show-2017/audience.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;A good audience for the Magic Science Show!&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I started the show by making myself a &amp;ldquo;chemuccino&amp;rdquo;, telling the audience that it should get really frothy. After much stirring with a wooden-stick, nothing appeared to happen! However, what I had mixed were equal amounts of monomers that react together to make a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyurethane&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;polyurethane&lt;/a&gt;. As the reaction proceeded, a creamy biege foam rose out of the coffee cup, spilling over the sides before hardening.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;https://mcoster.net/img/magic-science-show-2017/chemuccino.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Starting with a &amp;#39;chemuccino&amp;#39;.&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Acting a somewhat embarrassed that things were going badly already, I told the audience, that we needed a magical blue liquid on the stage for the magic to happen. Cohan brought out a colourless liquid in a sealed bottle, which went deep blue on shaking - magic! The solution contains &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylene_blue&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;methylene blue&lt;/a&gt;, glucose and sodium hydroxide in water. The latter two components reduce the methylene blue to a colourless form. Shaking the bottle disssolves some oxygen from the headspace above the liquid, which oxidises the methylene blue back to its coloured form. After shaking, as the bottle is left to sit on a table, the methylene blue is reduced again over a period of minutes and the solution returns to colourless. The RSC has a write-up of this &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rsc.org/learn-chemistry/resource/res00000729/the-blue-bottle-experiment?cmpid=CMP00005928&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&amp;lsquo;blue bottle&amp;rsquo; experiment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;https://mcoster.net/img/magic-science-show-2017/methylene-blue.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;The magical blue bottle.&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Under the pretense that we needed a solution on stage that would stay blue, I then set up a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belousov%E2%80%93Zhabotinsky_reaction&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Belousov&amp;ndash;Zhabotinsky&lt;/a&gt; reaction. I find these oscillating reactions fascinating because they are so unusual compared to the typical, uni-directional kinetics that we normally see. I told the audience that the reaction should slowly turn a deep blue and stay that way, but instead, it oscillates in a very non-linear fashion between shades of yellow, orange, blue and grey.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;https://mcoster.net/img/magic-science-show-2017/Belousov.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Setting up the oscillating reaction - not much to see in a still image!&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now a bit exasperated at the inability to maintain a magical blue solution on stage, I set up an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rsc.org/learn-chemistry/resource/res00000744/iodine-clock-reaction?cmpid=CMP00005152&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&amp;lsquo;iodine clock&amp;rsquo; reaction&lt;/a&gt;. The chemistry involved in this one is a bit easier to explain than the Belousov&amp;ndash;Zhabotinsky reaction. A H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; solution is mixed with a solution of potassium iodide, starch and sodium thiosulfate. I told the audience to watch very carefully because the solution would gradually turn blue. So gradually, they may not notice at first&amp;hellip; The reactions here involve i) oxidation of the iodide to iodine by the hydrogen peroxide, and ii) reduction of the iodine back to iodide by thiosulfate. However, the thiosulfate is limiting, and once it runs out, the iodine liberated reacts with iodide to give I&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;ndash;&lt;/sup&gt; which forms a deep blue complex with starch. In fact, the reaction happens extremely suddenly and the colour is so intense, it looks like the solution instantly goes from colourless to black. This one is my personal favourite:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; padding-top: 30px; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/iql6r2qLFx0&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;&#34; allowfullscreen frameborder=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With yet another failure to make a persistent blue solution for the magic to happen, and being quite thirsty, I demonstrated the &amp;lsquo;rainbow connection&amp;rsquo;. Cohan had previously placed a series of indicators in several wine glasses on the table. Adding a &amp;lsquo;shot&amp;rsquo; of dilute sulfuric acid in ethanol to each glass gives a colourless solution. I then asked the audience to list off the colours of the rainbow - &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROYGBIV&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;ROYGBIV&lt;/a&gt;! I then poured aqueous sodium hydroxide from a jug into each glass, giving a different colour of the rainbow in each one. The indicators are selected to be colourless at low pH and coloured at high pH.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;https://mcoster.net/img/magic-science-show-2017/rainbow-connection.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;ROYGBIV! Everyone loves colours, don&amp;#39;t they?&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Having now failed to quench my thirst, I tried to pour myself, into a poystyrene cup, a drink of water. Cohan had put a small amount of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_polyacrylate&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;sodium polyarylate&lt;/a&gt; into the cup beforehand. This stuff is amazing! It can absorb up to 300 x its own weight in water, so when I poured myself some water, I pretended to be confused at where the water went, inverting the cup - surprisingly, no water came out! Further portions of water can be added to the cup, which can then be turned upside down, with no water coming out!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;https://mcoster.net/img/magic-science-show-2017/1200px-Sodium_polyacrylate.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Dude, where&amp;#39;s my water?&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt; 
        &lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;With all but one of the magic tricks now spent, we finished the show with the spectacular catalytic decomposition of hydrogen peroxide. To adjacent measuring cylinders containing potassium iodide, detergent and food colouring, was added 30% hydrogen peroxide, resulting in colourful foam columns to end the show. Chromium salts are even more active catalysts, but unfortunately&amp;hellip; carcinogenic!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;https://mcoster.net/img/magic-science-show-2017/finale.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;The finale - foam columns!&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I had a great time and the kids in the audience seemed to like it. Hopefully some of them are inspired by science. Big thanks to Cohan for many hours of preparatory work that he did, and for being my side-kick (or was I his side-kick?..) on the day. Also, huge gratitude to the technical staff in Chemistry at Griffith University for their efforts, and my colleagues, past and present who developed the majority of these demonstrations!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A bidirectional synthesis of spiroacetals via Rh(II)-catalysed C-H insertion</title>
      <link>https://mcoster.net/post/bidirectional-spiros/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 31 Jul 2017 16:04:02 +1000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://mcoster.net/post/bidirectional-spiros/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Molecules where two rings are joined together through a single atom are known as spirocyclic compounds. A particular type, called spiroacetals, are common in biologically-active molecules from nature. We show, for the first time, an efficient new method for making spiroacetals from simple, acyclic starting materials.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;https://mcoster.net/img/animated-spiro.gif&#34; alt=&#34;animated spiroacetal&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;A 5,5-spiroacetal synthesised by this method&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Spiroacetals are exciting molecular scaffolds for discovering new drugs. Our method takes simple acyclic precursors and, by using small amounts of Rh(II) catalysts, converts them into spiroacetals with 3-dimensional structures that make them potentially useful building blocks for drug discovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;div style=&#34;height: 400px; width: 500px; position: relative; width: 100%; margin: 0 auto;&#34; class=&#39;viewer_3Dmoljs&#39; data-href=&#39;/pdb/spiro.pdb&#39; data-backgroundcolor=&#39;0xffffff&#39; data-style=&#39;stick&#39;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    &lt;h4&gt;A &lt;em&gt;C&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; 5,5-spiroacetal synthesised by this method (interactive!)
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mcoster.net/publication/lepage2017/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;This paper&lt;/a&gt; is one of my proudest basic science achievements. It started with an idle wondering about whether these types of compounds could be made &amp;ldquo;backwards&amp;rdquo; compared to how they had been synthesised in the past. The most common methods for spiroacetal synthesis involve formation of the rings through C-O forming reactions. This new work relies on C-C bond-forming events to form the rings. Although the seed of the idea was planted more than ten years ago, it took time to mature, and the end result is, in many respects, much better than the original idea. I particularly enjoyed getting my hands dirty in the lab to play with aspects of this project during a fantastic period of study leave at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mskcc.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC)&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mskcc.org/research-areas/labs/derek-tan/overview&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Prof. Derek Tan&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Electronic Lab Notebooks (ELN) for the Open Source Malaria (OSM) initiative: A video tutorial</title>
      <link>https://mcoster.net/post/eln-osm/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 27 Jul 2017 22:30:02 +1000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://mcoster.net/post/eln-osm/</guid>
